# MachineLearning

##Softmax_learning

The first chart represents three clusters of points. The program estimates to which of those clusters a given point might belong. The last chart shows the loss value that lowers after each iteration of the machine learning loop.
The program was created in the earlier version of TensorFlow - v1.0

##GradientOptimizer

The program solves the function with two variables finding its minimum. It runs using new TensorFlow 2.0
