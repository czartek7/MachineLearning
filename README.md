# MachineLearning

##Softmax_learning

The first chart represents three groups of points. The program estimates to which of those clusters a given point might be put. The last chart shows the loss value that lowers after each iteration of the machine learning loop.
The program was created earlier and it runs on TensorFlow 1.0

##GradientOptimizer

The program solves the function with two variables finding its minimum. It runs using new TensorFlow 2.0
